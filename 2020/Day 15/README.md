## Part 1

In Part 1, we were asked to simulate (at least for now, I haven't found a better solution) the game with the following rules: 

> In this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of starting numbers (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:
>
> If that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player says 0.
> Otherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces how many turns apart the number is from when it was previously spoken.

To store numbers, we can use a [dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), where each number will be matched to its last occurrence: 

```python
nums = {num: last_spoken_index}
```

We can also take advantage of Python's dictionary implementation to get the default value if it is not present using the [`get`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get) function. 

```python
last = nums.get(cur, step)
```

So now `last` contains the index of the last occurrence of the current number. Then we store the index of the current number in the dictionary (`nums[cur] = step`) and calculate the next number (`cur = step - last`).

Thus, if a number has not been spoken, `cur` will be equal to `step (default value) - step = 0`. 

The answer will be the 2020th number spoken:

<!-- Execute code: "part1.py" -->
```python
with open("input.txt", 'r', encoding="utf-8") as file:
    inp = list(map(int, file.readline().split(',')))

nums = {num: i + 1 for i, num in enumerate(inp[:-1])}

cur = inp[-1]

for step in range(len(inp), 2020):
    last = nums.get(cur, step)
    nums[cur] = step
    cur = step - last

print(cur)
```
```
253
```

## Part 2

In Part 2, we were asked to simulate the same game with the same rule, except now until the `30 * 10^6`th step.

As I mentioned earlier, I haven't come up with anything smarter, so this is a 10s+ implementation:

<!-- Execute code: "part2.py" -->
```python
with open("input.txt", 'r', encoding="utf-8") as file:
    inp = list(map(int, file.readline().split(',')))

nums = [None] * 30_000_000
for i, num in enumerate(inp[:-1]):
    nums[num] = i + 1

cur = inp[-1]
for step in range(len(inp), 30_000_000):
    last, nums[cur] = nums[cur], step
    cur = 0 if last is None else step - last

print(cur)
```
```
